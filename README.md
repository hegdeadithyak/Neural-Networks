# Neural-Networks
Implementing neural networks from scratch in C++.

Two inputs A,B(lets say) and they are two discrete variables.Predict output using AB for a OR GATE logic circuit.

## Overview

The repository includes the following files:

- `Neuralnetworksfromscratch.cpp`: Source code for building and training a neural network from scratch.
- `PredictingfromTrainedwts.cpp`: Source code for using trained weights to make predictions.
- `weights_and_biases.txt`: Text file containing saved weights and biases from a trained neural network.
- `.gitignore`: Git configuration file specifying intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- `LICENSE`: License information for the repository.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository and its contents.

## Usage

1. **Training the Neural Network**:
   - Compile and run `Neuralnetworksfromscratch.cpp` to train the neural network.
   - The trained weights and biases will be saved into `weights_and_biases.txt`.

2. **Making Predictions**:
   - Compile and run `PredictingfromTrainedwts.cpp` to use the trained weights for making predictions.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler capable of handling C++11 or later.
- Standard libraries for file handling and basic math operations.
